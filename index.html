        <b>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the
                intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers
                can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity,
                there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in
                performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines and voice.</p1>

            <<h1>the history of Articial Intelligence</h1>
                <b>The first patent for the invention of the telephone happened in 1876 and AI was introduced at a much later stage.

                In true terms, the field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during 1956.
                
                At that time, it was predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true
                
                Investment and interest in AI rose in the first decades of the 21st century. From that time, Machine Learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to the presence of a powerful computer.
                
                1950 – The time when it all started
                So now this concept has been around for decades but, until 1950, people were unaware of the term. John McCarthy who is known as the founder of Artificial Intelligence introduced the term in the year 1955.
                
                McCarthy along with Alan Turing, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky is known as the founding fathers of AI. Alan suggested that if humans use available information, to solve problems to make decisions

            <h1>How is AI USED?</h1>
            <h2>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories:</h2>
            <b>Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines
        may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.

        </p2>
        <p3> <b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general
        intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.

                <h2> HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE</h2>
                <b>Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being. Artificial intelligence has acted as the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and it will continue to act as a technological
    innovator for the foreseeable future
     Employing machine learning and computer vision for detection and classification of various “safety events,” the shoebox-sized device doesn’t see all, but it sees plenty. Like which way the driver is looking as
    he operates the vehicle, how fast he’s driving, where he’s driving, locations of the people around him and how other forklift operators are maneuvering their vehicles. IFM’s software automatically detects safety violations 
 and notifies warehouse managers so they can take immediate action. The main goals are to prevent accidents and increase efficiency.The mere knowledge that one of IFM’s devices is watching.</b>

        <h1>how artificial intelligence can be dangerous</h1>
        <b>Every coin has two sides and so does AI. Any powerful technology can be misused. In today’s time, artificial intelligence is used for many good causes. Like, just to name a few, it is helping in making better medical diagnoses, finding new ways to cure cancer and make our cars safer.

            But, unfortunately, as the AI capabilities expand it is getting misused too. It is used for dangerous or malicious purposes by some people.<br>
            
            Since AI technology is advancing so rapidly, it is crucial for us to make sure that the technology is in safer hands. It is very important for us to develop it positively while minimizing its destructive potential.
            
            Now, I think you must have got the answer to the questions – Is AI dangerous and if yes, then how it poses danger to humanity? <a href="index4.html ">the expert's opinion in AI risk</a></b>
